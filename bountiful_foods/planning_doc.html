            <h2>Site Name and Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The name of the web page will be Bountiful Foods. Bountiful 
                Foods is a small business specializing in organic, locally grown 
                foods. They are physically located in Carlsbad, California, however,
                they have many food trucks that cover the coastal area from Los 
                Angeles to San Diego. The company sells fruits and produce directly
                from the farmers in the area, but also uses some national and international
                suppliers. The owner-operated company caters to walk in traffic at their 
                storefront in Carlsbad and, of course, their food trucks. They deliver and 
                manage those orders on the phone and via the website. The mission is to 
                provide fresh and healthy food options, including organic, made to order, 
                fruit drinks and fruit bags, to the local population and to tourists visiting 
                the coastal areas.

            <h2>Target Audience and Scenarios</h2>
            <p>
                Persona 1: A user who is health-conscious and cares about 
                consuming fresh, natural ingredients would be more inclined to visit a web page 
                for fresh smoothies made of fresh fruit rather than a smoothie chain that may
                use processed or artificial ingredients in their products. They may want to 
                know more about the nutritional value of the smoothies, the source of the 
                ingredients, and any potential health benefits associated with consuming fresh fruit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Persona 2: A user who has food allergies or sensitivities may be more 
                interested in a web page that offers fresh smoothies made from specific fruits 
                that they know they can consume safely. For example, if someone is allergic to 
                certain preservatives or artificial sweeteners commonly found in smoothie chains,
                they may opt for a fresh fruit smoothie that is made with only natural 
                ingredients and free from any potential allergens.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Persona 3: A user who is passionate about supporting local businesses and 
                sustainable agriculture may be more interested in a web page that sources its 
                ingredients from local farms and markets. They may want to know more about the 
                farms and farmers who grow the fruit used in the smoothies, as well as the 
                environmental impact of sourcing locally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Persona 4 : A user who is particularly discerning about the taste and 
                quality of their food may be more interested in a web page that offers a variety
                of unique and flavorful fresh fruit smoothies. They may be interested in trying 
                new and exotic fruits or combinations of fruits that they may not find at other 
                smoothie chains. They may also appreciate the opportunity to customize their 
                smoothies to their liking, choosing the specific fruits and other ingredients 
                that go into their drink.
